### Help out!

There are a number of macros that have yet to be implemented for T-SQL. Check out
- the issues page, or
- [this file](integration_tests/dbt_utils/dbt_project.yml) for an idea of which macros are not currently supported.

### Dev environment set-up

0. clone this repo
1. open terminal in top-level dir of project
2. run the following to install dbt-utils as a submodule
    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils` 
3. open terminal in `integration_tests/dbt_utils`
4. configure your `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` to have an `integration_tests` section with a `sqlserver` target set as the default like `integrations_tests/ci/sample.profiles.yml` does
5. run all the commands listed in the "Run Tests - dbt-utils" step of `.circleci/config.yml` namely:
    ```bash
    dbt deps --target sqlserver
    dbt seed --target sqlserver --full-refresh
    dbt run --target sqlserver --full-refresh
    dbt test --target sqlserver
    ```

### Multi-Adapter Support

t-sql-utils applies for 2 adapters, sqlserver and synapse.

Therefore, for the time being, a macro should be implemented twice, once for the functionality and once as a reference for the second adapter. 

Imagine an adapter plugin, dbt-synapse, that inherits from dbt-sqlserver.
For the time being, we need to explicitly reimplement sqlserver__ macros as synapse__ macros. This looks like: 

```
{% macro synapse__get_tables_by_pattern_sql(field) %}
    {% do return( tsql_utils.synapse__get_tables_by_pattern_sql(schema_pattern, table_pattern, exclude='', database=target.database)) %}
{% endmacro %}
```

TODO: We can make a small change to dbt-core (https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2923) that will make the inheritance of dispatched macros work just like the inheritance of other adapter objects, and render the following code redundant.
