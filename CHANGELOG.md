## `0.6.4`

first release!

as of now, all 39 of dbt-utils's macros work on `dbt-sqlserver` and `dbt-synapse` except for the 10 listed below. We hope to bring these macros in a future release!

    insert_by_period materialization
    date_spine
    test_mutually_exclusive_ranges() #18
    all the url macros (get_url_host, get_url_path, get_url_host()
    generate_series()
    get_relations_by_pattern()
    get_relations_by_prefix_and_union()
    union_relations()

these 5 macros are supported for SQL Server and Azure SQL, but aren't yet officially supported right now on Synapse because of <https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-synapse/issues/36> breaks dbt-utils's integration tests.

    dateadd()
    datediff()
    split_part()
    last_day()
    test-hash()
